# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System

## Overview

This project presents a **Movie Recommender System** that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze user preferences and provide personalized movie suggestions. The system features an interactive user interface built with **Streamlit**, enabling users to receive real-time recommendations.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Utilizes NLP to interpret user input and suggest movies tailored to individual tastes.
- **Interactive Interface**: Streamlit-based UI for seamless and intuitive user interactions.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Immediate analysis and recommendation generation based on user inputs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SuryaVegesna27/Movie-Recommender-System.git
   cd Movie-Recommender-System

Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage


Run the Application:
streamlit run app.py


Interact with the Interface:

Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (typically http://localhost:8501).
Input your movie preferences or select from available options to receive tailored recommendations.
Project Structure
app.py: Main application script containing the Streamlit interface and recommendation logic.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the application.
data/: Directory containing datasets used for training and reference.
models/: Directory for storing trained NLP models and related artifacts.



How It Works
Data Collection: Gathers movie data, including titles, genres, descriptions, and user reviews.
NLP Processing: Applies Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze movie descriptions and user reviews to understand sentiment and thematic elements.

User Input Analysis: Processes user inputs to capture preferences and desired movie attributes.
Recommendation Generation: Matches user preferences against the processed movie data to suggest titles that align with the user's tastes.
